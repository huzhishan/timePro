# Time Perception Enhancement Software
[English](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)

With AI assistance, I built a time perception enhancement software from scratch that displays the proportion of current time in a day, as well as the proportion of today's date in the entire year.

The Yearly progress bar and Daily ring update in real-time, calculating and displaying percentages every second (as seen in the final few seconds). This is particularly beneficial for ADHD patients to enhance their time perception.

Currently available in three versions:
1. Web version: timePro.html, also accessible directly via this link: https://v0-time-tracker-huzhishan-huzhishans-projects.vercel.app/
2. Python version: timePro.py
3. Windows version: available for download through release.

The Windows version appears as a desktop widget when double-clicked, as shown below:
